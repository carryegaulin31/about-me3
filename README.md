# Technical Skills

I have a natural understanding of lots of technolgy that I use on a daily basis, it makes sense.
I also have a strong desire to learn and succeed and that will be what brings me through this course.

## For Fun
* Love fishing of any kind
* Getting lost in a fantastic book
* Traveling to exotic or remote new locations
* Meeting new people
* Adventures and exploring

My name is Carrye Gaulin.  I am currently a student on my way to learning software development.
It is absolutly nerve wrecking but I am holding on tight. I have zero experience so I like to think I have zero bad habits.
